# Weather-Dash-6

This weeks challenge is to create a weather dashboard that features the OpenWeather One Call server side API. This application presents the user with 
the ability to search cities, get the city's current weather, and a 5 day forecast. This dashboard is visually pleasing with it's use of icons and
colors that indicate how severe the weather conditions are. This challenge exposes the developer to reading through documentation regarding the API, further knowledge 
of Bootstrap and local storage.   

Additional Notes: Due to challenges and demands of project week, I was unable to complete this assignment. This is a placeholder for the final product. Thank you!
